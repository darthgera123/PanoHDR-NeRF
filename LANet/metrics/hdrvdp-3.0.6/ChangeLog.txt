08 June 2020 HDR-VDP 3.0.6
   * Refitted the CSF function. 
   * Can now easily switch between different MTFs of the eye (with minimum impact on the predictions).
   * "peak_sensitivity" replaced with more intuitive "sensitivity_correction". 
   * Added 'mtf' option to select model of glare (or disable it)
   * Added 'age' option to select an age of the participant. Age-related changes are now switched on by default. 
   * Added a simple model of local adaptation based on the SIGGRAPG 2015 paper (see utils/hdrvdp_local_adapt.m)
   * Quality predictions recalibrated on the UPIQ dataset
   * Added examples of predicting image quality in "examples" folder

(internal) HDR-VDP 3.0.5
   * The detection of low frequencies is now based on the dominant frequency 
     in the base band (instead of filtering in the Fourier domain). This 
     approach seems to be more rebust.
   * Fixed bug in civdm which caused wrong luminance to be used for the sensitivity.

(internal) HDR-VDP 3.0.4
   * Fixed typo in the CSF params
   * Removed resampling from the Steerable pyramid decomposition
   * "detection" model refitted to modelfest and others

(internal) HDR-VDP 3.0.3
   * Fixed luminance adaptation in civdm to be independent for the test and reference images

(internal) HDR-VDP 3.0.3
   * Redesigned the logic behind civdm so that it should be more robust
   * Fixed a bug in the Contrast Invariant Visible Difference Metric (civdm) preventing a proper use of the CSF

(internal) HDR-VDP 3.0.1
   * The color spectra handling has been updated to map images to the desired color space, such as rec.709 or rec.2020
   * Added color spectra of modern displays

(internal) HDR-VDP 3.0.0
   * HDR-VDP is now configured differently for different tasks, such as 'side-by-side' or 'flicker' comparison
   * Calibrated on the dataset from: http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3196493, http://visibility-metrics.mpi-inf.mpg.de/
   * The metric includes age-dependent components from the paper: http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsid.623     
   * Added Contrast Invariant Visible Difference Metric (a.k.a.) Dynamic Range Independent Metrics
      - This metric is not identical to the one in the original paper. See the documentation of hdrvdp3() for details/ 

(internal) HDR-VDP 2.2.2
   * Added an experimental "cmp_mask" option
   * Fixed a few typos in the documentation

21 January 2015 HDR-VDP 2.2.1
   * Fixed issue when "Q" varied with image size. Q is now scaled 
     differently: 100 for the best quality and gets lower.
   * Q_MOS has been removed as unreliable. Use "Q instead. Note that the 
     relation between Q and MOS is not specified for now.
   * Some memory optimizations

19 October 2014 HDR-VDP 2.2.0

   * Improved quality predictions (pooling function optimized for HDR quality data set).
   * matlabPyrTools bundled with HDR-VDP-2 for easier installation
   * New improved hdrvdp_visualize.m
   * Surround luminance (surround_l) is set to very low luminance (1e-5) by default
   * Added check for very low physical values to avoid a common misuse for color encodings
   * Minor performance improvement (caching)

21 January 2013 HDR-VDP 2.1.3

   * Updated documentation
   * Better compatibility with earlier versions of matlab
   * Better handling of surround_l - if computed automatically, it is kept 
     the same for both reference and test images. This avoids false detection
     at the image boarder.

27 October 2011 HDR-VDP 2.1.2

   * Updated "epsilon" values that prevent NaN due to log of 0, but
     also cause Q_MOS to be relatively low for two identical images

30 August 2011 HDR-VDP 2.1.1

   * Fixed CSF formula in the code to be consistent with the
     paper. The CSF fitting parameters were updated as well.

17 June 2011  HDR-VDP 2.1

   * Extened model: CSF measured at 0.002 cd/m^2
   * New fit: fit to the new CSF measurements
   * New measurements: csfla dataset
   * New measurements: complexfest dataset
   * Bug fixed: nCSF did not change below 1 cd/m^2

28 April 2011  HDR-VDP 2.0

   This is the initial release, included with the supplementary
   materials of the SIGGRAPH'11 paper.
